# Members only project using Ruby on Rails

In this project, you’ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo 

``` 
git clone  https://github.com/macnick/members-only.git 
```
Then install the needed gems:

```
bundle install --without production 
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
 rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the app in a local server:

```
 rails server
```
